today was the absolute worst day ever

and don't try to convince me that

there's something good in everyday

because, when you take a closer look

this world is a pretty evil place

even If

some goodness does shine through once in a while

satisfaction and happiness don't last

and It's not true that

it's all in the mind and heart

because

true happiness can be obtained

only if one's surroundings are good

it's not true that good exists

I'm sure you can agree that

the reality

creates

my attitude

it's all beyond my control

and you'll never In a million years hear me say that

today was a good day
